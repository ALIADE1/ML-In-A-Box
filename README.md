# ML-In-A-Box ðŸ§°

Welcome to **ML-In-A-Box**! This repository is a collection of **machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch** in Python. The goal of this project is to provide a clear and educational understanding of how popular ML algorithms work under the hood, without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of machine learning or an experienced developer wanting to dive deeper into algorithmic implementations, this repository is for you!
